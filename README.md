# TsukiUsagiTimer 🐇

> A poetic Pomodoro timer inspired by the moon and the quiet spirit of TsukiUsagi.

---

## Concept

When focus starts to fade, gazing at the steadily waxing and waning moon or the flowing stars helps restore concentration, while the word *Centered* reminds users of their inner axis.

## Rhythmic Synchronization

Consistent rhythms induce alpha brain waves, scientifically linked to reduced stress and improved focus.

## Target Users

Minimalists worldwide.
All text in English, with a clean and simple visual aesthetic.

## Features

- A gentle user interface built with SwiftUI
